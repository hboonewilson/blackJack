# Java Black Jack
<p>
I'm attempting to create a blackJack that runs 
on user's input from the command line at the
moment. From there, I'll attempt to add in 
HTTP or REST API calls and put on AWS! 
Then create a react front end.

<h3>//TODO</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add mockito and create more robust test for 
each class
</li>
<li>Refactor classes to different packages</li>
<li>Create get/post interface </li>
</ul>
